Easy to use Key Value storage interface for Acunu Analytics.

Uses WebSockets and JSON RPC to for fast, easy storage and retrieval of data over HTTP from a range of applications.

Easy to write, injectable pre-processors to extract structure from your data, forward data to other consumers, make RPC calls to connected clients (broadcast, channel-wise or individually)... the sky's the limit.

Runs in node.js and requires an Acunu Analytics cluster for persistance.
